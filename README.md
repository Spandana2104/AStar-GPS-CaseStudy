# A* Pathfinding Algorithm – GPS Navigation Case Study

This case study demonstrates the use of the A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm in simulating GPS navigation. The algorithm is visualized in real-time, showing how it efficiently finds the shortest path in a grid-based environment with random obstacles.

## 📌 Project Overview

The A* algorithm is widely used in navigation systems like GPS for finding optimal routes between two points. This project implements A* in Java with a Swing-based GUI to help visualize its operation in a simplified map environment.

## 🧠 Key Features

- User-defined grid size and node input
- Random obstacle generation
- A* pathfinding algorithm
- Real-time GUI visualization using Java Swing
- Highlights path (blue), explored area (red), and obstacles (black)
